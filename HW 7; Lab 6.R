#Question 3:
#We decided to analyze labor market. We are still looking for data and articles. But initial research have led us to find some information.
#Reading a CBS news article we found that there has been a decrease of people in finance. Recent graduates have
#seen how labor market is impacted by pandemic. In addition, the graduates are learning to be versatile to have 
#various career opportunities. The graduates are optimistic that they will find a job.

#We also read little research article by going to Econ lit about wage differentials in the labor market.Based 
#on the reading, different jobs pay different. The degree is not the only factor that determines the wage in 
#a job. There are other variables such as risk associated with the job. We will continue to find more article
#analyze them for the project.
